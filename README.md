# delve_cs_test
testing

## Installation (on midway):

module load midway2 python/anaconda-2020.02

conda env create --file delve_shear.yml #this is actually not working for some reason - it gets the wrong scipy version?

#I tried exporting the environment from midway as a yaml too, but seems like that won't work in a different place
